			<p>I'm a college student currently finishing up my associates in animation.</p>
			<p>
			I have no experience in the professional animation industry but my passion 
			is limitless and the experience Iâ€™ve received through my classes and one on 
			one talks with professional animators have breathed life into my already burning passion. </p>	
			
            <p>I've always had this profound love for cartoons. As a child, I used to go out of my way to watch the making-of 
and behind-the-scenes special features to gain a better understanding
 of how cartoons came to life.</p>

<p> I found myself admiring countless animators 
and voice actors, to the point where it felt almost 
impossible not to envision myself as an animator in my later years.</p>

<p>There's something truly special about reminiscing over the classics
and fawning over newly released cartoons. It brings me great joy to 
see the animation industry grow and flourish, I'd give anything to participate someday.</p>

<p>My dream is to make animation the central focus of 
my entire life, creating my own cartoons someday. It's a lifelong goal that
resonates deeply within my soul.</p>
